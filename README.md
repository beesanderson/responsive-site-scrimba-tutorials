#  yet another Scrimba CSS/HTML Tutorial Collection

## Featured: 
1. Helpful FlexBox How Tos
2. Navigation Bar How Tos
3. Media Queries in different page layouts 
- 5 different page dimensions 


Another old repo I made doing "code alongs" with Scrimba. Each section has a little readme with some notes and code snips if anyone is interested. 

Just fun to see how not to long ago I was still learning how media queries worked...for the first time!
